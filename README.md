# Searching Algorithms

## Linear Search

Over an Ordered Array O(1): Iterates over each element of the array and returns the index of some value (v), if found.

- Big O
  - O(n). f(n) is directly proportional to n size

## Binary Search

Iterates over an Ordered Array O(1). Reduces the array by half at each iteration based on the position of middle element, when compared
to the needle to de found. Returns true if found and false if not.

- Big O
  - O(log2 n).
